# Cuddly Potato

An image generator with a RESTful API.


## Requirements

A nightly Rust toolchain. If you use `rustup` you can override your default
toolchain on a per-project basis with the command
```
rustup override set nightly
```


## How to Use

Build with cargo
```
cargo build
```

Or you tell it to build with optimizations & run:
```
cargo run --release
```

Once Cuddly Potato is running, it can be accessed at
`http://localhost:8000`. Check the links on the index page to see how the
API is used.
